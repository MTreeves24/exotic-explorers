                <h1 class="title">The Human Team</h1>
                <p>Set up by professional Zoo Keepers who met while working at Tropical Wings Zoo. After its very sad closure in December of 2017, Exotic Explorers was set up to continue to spread passion for animal welfare and education.</p>
                <p>Exotic Explorers is a limited company registered with companies house. We hold public liability insurance with £5million of cover. We hold an Animal Activities Licence (AAL: 19/00064/LIANI), which from the 1st April 2019 is a legal requirement under the Animal Welfare Act (licensing of activities involving animals, England Regulations 2018). </p>
                <p>All of our team are DBS checked and first aid trained. We have no animals that require a DWA (Dangerous Wild Animal Licence) and all our animals have their appropriate paperwork where necessary, A10 Certificates under CITES (Convention for the International Trade of Endangered Species).</p>
                <p>The Company has over 18 years of professional animal care experience as well as years of personal animal keeping. We have a wealth of knowledge and enjoy nothing more than passing on our experiences to others and inspiring a new generation to love and respect our wonderful natural world.</p>

                <p>Ben has always had a love of animals and his passion started at the age of 7 when he got his first Hamster.</p>
                <p>Ben holds a BSc Honours degree in Veterinary Science which he obtained from the Royal Veterinary College. During his working life Ben has had a number of different jobs within the animal sector, including store and livestock manager at a pet company, an exotic animal keeper and party presenter at animal sanctuaries, and a Tropical, Mammal and Bird Keeper in Zoological institutions.</p>
                <p>At Tropical Wings Zoo, Ben was one of the Senior Bird Keepers and enjoyed nothing more than presenting and training the animals in front of an excited crowd.</p> 
                <p>Ben's specialities include birds, reptiles and invertebrates.  Now through Exotic Explorers Ben hopes to continue to inspire younger and older people alike showing them just how amazing animals are.</p>

                  <p>Puri has loved being around animals since the moment she was born and shared her cot with her parents’ dog.</p>
                  <p>Puri is a veterinary assistant and also has a certificate in environmental enrichment. She has worked with animals since the age of 16, starting in Mundomar Benidorm (Spain) as a Bird Keeper and Trainer where she worked for 9 years. After that she was the sole person responsible for a parrot breeding center and also a Senior Keeper and Head Trainer in Tropical Wings Zoo.</p>
                  <p>After the zoo closure she created her own company as a pet sitter and trainer until 2020 when she joined Ben at Exotic Explorers.</p>
                  <p>Puri's speciality are birds but she also trains other animals such as mammals and some reptiles. She is an experienced presenter and is always trying to learn more things about her animals, not only to share it later with all of you but also to pass on her love and admiration for animals.</p>

                <p>Carol is invaluable to the Exotic Explorers team, spending most of her time preparing food for both the animal and human teams. She is great at helping socialise our team and get them ready for a busy life of education and experiences.</p><p>She is a confident presenter with a wealth of animal knowledge, and is also Ben's Mum. She is probably the main reason Exotic Explorers exists having always encouraged Ben’s passion for animals and pushed him to learn more and get more experience.</p>
