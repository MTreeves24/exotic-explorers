                <h1 class="title">The Human Team</h1>
                <p>Set up by professional Zoo Keepers who met while working at Tropical Wings Zoo. After its very sad closure in December of 2017, Exotic Explorers was set up to continue to spread passion for animal welfare and education.</p>
                <p>Exotic Explorers is a limited company registered with companies house. We hold public liability insurance with £5million of cover. We hold an Animal Activities Licence (AAL: 19/00064/LIANI), which from the 1st April 2019 is a legal requirement under the Animal Welfare Act (licensing of activities involving animals, England Regulations 2018). </p>
                <p>All of our team are DBS checked and first aid trained. We have no animals that require a DWA (Dangerous Wild Animal Licence) and all our animals have their appropriate paperwork where necessary, A10 Certificates under CITES (Convention for the International Trade of Endangered Species).</p>
                <p>The Company has over 18 years of professional animal care experience as well as years of personal animal keeping. We have a wealth of knowledge and enjoy nothing more than passing on our experiences to others and inspiring a new generation to love and respect our wonderful natural world.</p>

                <p>Hannah is amazing with Animals and her attention to detail and high standards are above expectations for anyone. Hannah has increased her skills and knowledge through volunteering with a local animal charity. She has been a confident presenter and now helps more on the Social media side of the business.</p>
